Description: This package contains a function of the same name, cTOST, that provides an assessment of equivalence in the univariate framework. This assessment is based on the state-of-the-art Two One-Sided Tests (TOST), and a corrective procedure applied to the TOST in order to ensure the preservation of the Type I error rate at the desired significance level and a uniform increase in power. More details can be found in Boulaguiem et al. (2023) that you can access via this link: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.11.532179v2.full

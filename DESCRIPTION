Description: A set of easy-to-use functions to compute the necessary components for the assessment of Equivalence in the univariate frameowrk. It is based on a correction procedure of the state-of-the-art Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) used in the assessment of Equivalence in the univariate framework, providing both the preservation of the type-I error at the desired significance level and a uniform increase in power.
